# EEG-based-digit-detection

Digit detection using EEG data presents an intriguing intersection of neuroscience and AI. This article showcases the implementation of a convolutional neural network to predict whether a subject was thinking about a digit, using EEG data recorded with a Muse headset.

Objective
The primary goal is to accurately classify EEG recordings into two categories: digits and non-digits (1 and 0 being respective labels).
